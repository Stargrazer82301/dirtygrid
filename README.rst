Code to acces the DirtyGrid of stellar+dust models of regions of galaxies.

The DirtyGrid provides full UV to submm SEDs of mixtures of stars and dust
calculated from the PEGASE stellar population synthesis models and the
DIRTY dust radiative transfer code.  The DirtyGrid was calculated as part of
Ka-Hei Law's PhD thesis (JHU, 2015).  [**add references**]
